    * @brief A Queue object
    * @details A queue is a linear data structure with simple operations based
    * on the FIFO (First In First Out) principle. It is capable to hold a finite
    * number of fixed-size data items. The maximum number of items that a queue
    * can hold is called its length. Both the length and the size of each data
    * item are set when the queue is created.
    *
    * In general, this kind of data structure is used to serialize data between
    * tasks, allowing some elasticity in time. In many cases, the queue is used
    * as a data buffer in interrupt service routines. This buffer will collect
    * the data so, at some later time, another task can fetch the data for
    * further processing. This use case is the single "task to task" buffering
    * case. There are also other applications for queues as serializing  many
    * data streams into one receiving streams (multiple tasks to a single task)
    * or vice-versa (single task to multiple tasks).
    *
    * The queue::setup() method configures the queue and initialize the instance.
    * The required RAM for the queue data should be provided by the application
    * writer and could be statically allocated at compile time or in run-time
    * using the memory management extension.
